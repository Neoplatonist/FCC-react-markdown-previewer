Free Code Camp - Wikipedia Viewer
=====================

This is my solution to the [FCC - Build a Wikipedia Viewer](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-markdown-previewer).
The live demo can be seen here: [CodePen](To be Added). # To be added

### Requirements
* Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/JXrLLE/.
* Rule #1: Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* Rule #2: Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
* Rule #3: You must use both Sass and React to build this project.
* User Story: I can type GitHub-flavored Markdown into a text area.
* User Story: I can see a preview of the output of my markdown that is updated as I type.
